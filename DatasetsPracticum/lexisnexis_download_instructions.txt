Go to LexisNexis via the UU proxy (use student ID + password to login):
http://bibe.library.uu.nl/zoek/biblio/index.php?recid=685&lang=nl

Click on 'Power Search' on the left menu bar.

Enter all the search information you want (at least 'search terms').

Now some results are shown.
There is a maximum of 1000 results.

To download the results, click on the Download button just above the list of results.

A download helper opens.
Under Download Options:
- Use 'Selected Items' and enter 1-200.
- Make sure 'Document view' is set to 'Full Text'.
Under Page Options:
- Untick 'Cover Page'.
- Tick 'Each Document on a New Page'.
Under Format Options:
- Set Document format to 'Text'.
- Untick 'Search Terms in Bold Type'.
Now click the Download button.

Repeat this process but replace 'Selected Items' with:
201-400
401-600
601-800
801-1000
You should have now 5 files collectively containing all 1000 results.

Manually copy-paste the contents (CTRL+A to select all) of each file (in order!) to a new file called
dataset.txt

This file is now ready to be processed using split_dataset.py
